        <h1>OLD FASHIONED GINGERBREAD</h1>
        <img src= "images/image.webp">
        <p>Nothing makes a house smell more like Christmas than the sweet and spicy aroma of a freshly baked pan of gingerbread.</p>
        <p>We're not talking about the crisp cookies or the houses covered in icing and candy. The taste of those holiday delights just can't compare to a slice of tender, richly spiced gingerbread cake.</p>
        <p>The practice of baking and sharing gingerbread originated in Europe several hundred years ago and then made its way to the colonial South as families immigrated to the region and brought their recipes and traditions with them.</p>
